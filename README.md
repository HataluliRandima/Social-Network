CONNECTING STUDENTS BASED ON SAME QUALITIES 

## Problem statement
1.Users(Students) struggles to get connected to other students which they share similar qualities and those other people appears on suggestion page.
 When they came across with some difficulties they cant get help from people of same level(qualities)(Courses and level of study) and with those who stays near them through their location .
 This will have probability of connection with students of same level and those who always online because will be them that can be helpful very fast and students can connect to lots of other students through

## High level proposed solutions
1.System will capture student details which can be Name, Course name, university name, year they are doing, and their location (in X and Y coordinates).
Student can be able to update their details through the system and can see the details of other students.
For the connection between vertices (Undergrad and Postgrad student versa versa) it will require them to input the distance between them and the connection will only happen if share same qualities and same level of study.
Based on the information provided, a graph will be drawn to then show the relationship those respective (Undergrad and Postgrad student versa versa).
Students can remove their connection with another student and can permanently delete other student.

## Technology Used
1. Java ( Graph ,Algorithm & data Structers ( BFS & DFS )
